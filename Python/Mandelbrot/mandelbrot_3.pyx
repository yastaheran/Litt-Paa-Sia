"""
Choose your favorite way of integrating C with Python. (We recommend
cython.) Make yet another script using that to do the same computations,
and compare the runtime to your previous examples. How much is gained by
switching to C?
In this problem the goal is to make your program more effective.
As such, getting a good score on this problem requires good use of
Cythonâ€™s features (or your module of choice) to improve the performance of
your program, so simply taking your existing solution from 4.1 or 4.2 and submitting
it without making any changes will not give you a good score.
